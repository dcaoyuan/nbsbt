nbsbt
=====

Plugin for sbt to create Netbeans project definition.

This project is derivated from [https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse)

1. nbsbt requires sbt 0.12+

1. Build and publish-local

        cd nbsbt
        sbt clean compile publish-local

1. Add nbsbt to your plugin definition file. You can use either the global one at ~/.sbt/plugins/plugins.sbt or the project-specific one at PROJECT_DIR/project/plugins.sbt:

        addSbtPlugin("org.netbeans.nbsbt" % "nbsbt-plugin" % "1.0.0")

1. In sbt, you can use the command "netbeans" to generate NetBeans project files:

        > netbeans

1. Or, in NetBeans, you do not need to run "netbeans" command manually, NetBeans will handle it automatically.
